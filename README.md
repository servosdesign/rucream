🍦 ruCream is a light mode, minimalistic, cream colored theme for vscode JavaScript applications and is heavily inspired by the [Ayu][] color themes. The base template of ruCream is a modification of the [Ayu Light][] theme's color choices while maintaining it's key concepts.

🍬 Designed as a light creamy theme, inspired by the iconic Russian cream dessert color palette, consisting of reds, creams, whites, and the signature glass or white bowl, which gives a sleek, minimalistic, and even delicious feeling to the code. We'd suggest using the [Azeret Mono][] font with a size of 11px, as shown in our screenshots below, for a more delicious experience.
